Swords are banned but people are still murdered in the streets. Orphans of war veterans are left with nowhere to go, while the government seems content to just line their pockets with money.

One wandering samurai, Kenshin Himura, still works to make sure the values he fought for are worth the lives spent to bring about the new era. Once known as Hitokiri Battousai, he was feared as the most ruthless killer of all the revolutionaries. Now haunted by guilt, Kenshin has sworn never to kill again in atonement for the lives he took, and he may never know peace until killing is a thing of the past.

Now in the 11th year of Meiji, Kenshin stumbles upon Kaoru Kamiya, owner and head instructor of a small dojo being threatened to close its doors. The police force is powerless to stop the string of murders done in the name of her dojo by a man claiming to be the famous Battousai. Kenshin's wanderings pause for now as he joins Kaoru to clear both their names. But how long can he stay before his past catches up to him?

Trapped at the bottom of Kunugigaoka's hierarchical education system, they face harsh discrimination from both teachers and students alike. Defeatism abound, they don't believe themselves capable of success in daily life, let alone against a monster that surpasses the abilities of any human. But as the enigmatic creature—whom they dub Koro-sensei—educates them in both assassination and academia, the children slowly find the courage to rise up and take aim at their target: the greatest teacher the world has ever seen.

Touched by his action, Sakura begins to develop feelings toward him.

One fateful day in their second year of high school, Sakura finally musters up the courage to confess. Swallowing her fears, she reveals it to him in a classroom after school. However, unbeknownst to her, Nozaki is actually a praised shoujo manga artist working under the pen name of ""Sakiko Yumeno."" His work is acclaimed for being sensitive toward girls' feelings, but Nozaki himself has no experience with love or being in a relationship.

All this results in him misunderstanding Sakura's confession as nothing but praise from a fan, and he simply hands her his autograph. One misunderstanding leads to another, and she somehow ends up working as an assistant for his manga. Gekkan Shoujo Nozaki-kun follows Sakura as she continually tries to convey her feelings to the oblivious Nozaki while helping him with his manga, as well as meeting his quirky assistants who coincidentally also attend Roman Academy.

Mikan naively believes that her aloof best friend would always be by her side until Hotaru decides to depart for Tokyo to attend Alice Academy. The school is home to gifted children who possess unique abilities known as ""Alices."" Heartbroken and feeling abandoned, Mikan runs away from home in pursuit of her friend, hoping that she too can enroll in the prestigious institution.

As Mikan gets accepted as a student at Alice Academy and reunites with her friend, she quickly learns that the academy is not all fun and games. The school itself is divided into a hierarchy system based on the strength of their Alice, behavior, and academic performance, as well as classifying each student under a specific Alice subgroup for a more personalized education. When she finds herself in the lowest rank, Mikan faces bullying from her classmates who all believe that she does not belong. Natsume Hyuuga, one of the academy's highest ranking students, is especially vitriolic towards Mikan for seemingly no reason.

The students begin to discover that the special academy has hidden secrets—many of which are a lot darker than one might think. As they unravel these mysteries, Mikan and her friends find themselves entangled in something far bigger than they could imagine.

Love takes on countless forms, but it is an emotion common to different kinds of people: childhood friends, tsunderes, classmates, delinquents, and student council presidents. Love can also flourish between unlikely pairs who bury their feelings deep within them, making it harder and harder to say that one notorious phrase in the human language... ""I love you.""

Tsurezure Children follows the journeys of numerous different couples and their romantic escapades. From the butterflies of a confession to the failed attempts at a first kiss, this story sheds light on the challenges and triumphs of young love.

Visiting Okinawa, Tokuchi's hometown, is Hiromichi Kojima, the star batter of the Saikyou Saitama Lycaons, the weakest team in the Japanese baseball league. Dreaming of leading the Lycaons to winning the championship, and in dire need of a replacement for their injured pitcher during a training camp, Kojima involves himself in a game of One Outs, only to lose to a normal fastball from the seemingly invincible Tokuchi.

Mesmerized by his prowess, Kojima recruits Tokuchi to the team after narrowly avoiding defeat in a rematch, believing he might just be their key to victory. However, the greedy owner of the Lycaons refuses to give him a decent salary, leading Tokuchi to suggest an unusual contract: every out he pitches will gain him five million yen, but every run he gives up will lose him fifty million yen. With his fate now tied to that of the team, Tokuchi's fight to bring the Lycaons to victory becomes yet another gamble—the very thing that he does best.

Yet his apprehender, the master sorcerer Satoru Gojou, has different plans for him: he will join Jujutsu High School and learn to control Rika in order to help people. Now a first-year at this school, Yuuta starts to learn Jujutsu arts and combat malignant beings. Alongside his new classmates Maki Zenin, a Jujutsu weapons expert; Toge Inumaki, a spellcaster who uses his words as weapons; and Panda, a seemingly walking and talking panda bear, Yuuta begins to find his place in the world and, for once, to feel comfortable with his abilities. However, as his training progresses, Yuuta comes to learn that the dangers of the Jujutsu world go far beyond that of wicked spirits.

However, things do not go as planned when, instead of the literature department, he is assigned to Emerald—the shoujo manga department! To make things worse, his new boss, Masamune Takano, is an unsubtle slave driver willing to go as far as kissing Onodera to act as a reference for a manga artist. Nevertheless, Onodera is driven to prove himself, hoping that his good performance will allow him to transfer someday.

Onodera slowly settles into the flow of the surprisingly all-male Emerald Department, and the romantically-themed work reminds him of his high school ex-boyfriend and first love. Not wanting to think about that jerk, he focuses on learning the ropes from Takano, who behaves strangely the more he learns about Onodera's past. It all comes to a head when they finally recognize each other: Takano is the jerk who broke Onodera's heart, but according to Takano, it was Onodera who suddenly left him without a word.

Emerald's passionate editors already know plenty about romance, but they can learn even more about it themselves once they meet their one and only true love. In Onodera's case, it is only a matter of time until he realizes that he is still very much in the middle of the ""world's greatest first love.""

If it was not for Takahiro, Misaki's beloved older brother and Usami's best friend, the two would never have crossed paths at all.

The hand dealt to the Colorata people—a minority forced into living in the ""nonexistent"" 86th district—is one of utter contempt and scorn. Looked upon as human filth, they are ordered to pilot the Juggernauts as Processors under the command of Republican Handlers.

Vladilena Milizé, a republican soldier with a strong sense of justice, detests the way her countrymen treat the 86. When she is assigned to the Spearhead Squadron as their handler, she meets a group of oddballs and eventually grows attached to them—particularly their captain, Shinei Nouzen, a boy with a pure sense of purpose and resolve. However, the path they walk is one riddled with death, and growing close to an 86 may have just set Vladilena down a path of despair.

Negi must now negotiate with the girl and face his most difficult challenge yet—to keep his identity a secret as he tackles magical threats both from within and outside of Mahora Academy, all the while keeping a watchful eye out for his lost father.

Practically a political hostage, Nakaba only has one attendant by her side: Loki, whose dog-like ears mark him as an ajin—a race of beings with animalistic traits who are looked down upon by the general populace.

Nakaba—the possession of her conceited husband, the discarded princess of a kingdom that saw her as their shame—expects to endure her pain and continue living life no matter what. However, a splash of crimson blood dyes her world in a red hue, awakening her power—the Arcana of Time. This ability allows her to see the past—her own, which she has locked away, and that of others—and the future.

But changing the future comes at a price, and to save one life means something else must be sacrificed in return. Amidst the rising tension on the continent, Nakaba must use her power to fight not only for peace, but also to save those she has grown to love.

His pitch during the last game catches the attention of a scout from the prestigious Seidou High School in Tokyo, who soon convinces a begrudging Sawamura to observe their school's nationally-ranked baseball team practice. At Seidou, an impromptu competition between Sawamura and one of their batters causes him to cross paths with Kazuya Miyuki—a catcher who can pull out Sawamura's strengths as a pitcher.

The experience he has accumulated at Seidou changes his initial reluctance to transfer to Tokyo. Although he still feels guilt over betraying his friends, they encourage him to take the offer and enroll in Seidou. Filled with a renewed sense of determination, Sawamura begins the arduous journey of becoming Seidou's team ace and heading for the nationals while carrying the spirit of his former school with him.

Masayuki is quick to take his friend to the infirmary before anyone else notices, though, once they are alone, he is in no hurry to have Keisuke remove the pantyhose: with Keisuke's shapely ankles and perfect form, it would be a sin not to worship his beautiful legs encased in sexy black nylon. Keisuke must find a way to deal with Masayuki's fetish before it escalates into something they are both unprepared for.

The person one step ahead of him is Chinatsu Kano, a first-year student in senior high and Taiki's crush.

Chinatsu is the rising star of the basketball team, and the gap between her and Taiki could not be greater.

His greatest joy in life is learning different types of erotic knots and maintaining his gear. Unfortunately, he lacks a partner to try all of the items in his collection.

Kaoru's ideal playmate is his childhood friend Nana Chigusa—the beautiful and popular vice-president of his school's student council. However, their relationship has worsened over the years because of their conflicting personalities. Kaoru neglects his studies in favor of his deviancy, while Nana is constantly stressed due to her focus on schoolwork.

Disappointed by Kaoru's study habits and erotic hobbies, his mother secretly gives Nana some of his S&M toys for safekeeping. Intrigued by the leather costume, Nana tries it on, only to end up accidentally locking herself in. After Kaoru frees her, she realizes that S&M helps her relax and, much to Kaoru's delight, asks to engage in more erotic stimulation sessions.

Vash does not clearly remember the destruction of July, and only wants ""love and peace,"" as he puts it; though he is a gunfighter of inhuman skill, he uses his weapons only to save lives wherever he can.

As the series progresses, more is gradually learned about Vash's mysterious history and the history of the human civilization on Gunsmoke, the desert planet the series is set on. The series is often humorous in tone, but at the same time it involves very serious character development and especially in later episodes it becomes quite emotionally intense. Vash is occasionally joined by a priest, Nicholas D. Wolfwood, who is almost as good a gunfighter as Vash himself, and later is targeted by a band of assassins known as the Gung-Ho Guns for reasons which are mysterious at first.

Trigun evolves into a very serious discussion of the nature of morality, posing questions such as: What is the nature of morality? Can we judge different moral codes? If a person is forced to betray their moral code, does that betrayal invalidate that moral code, and can the person still try to live up to that moral code? Can the person find redemption from their wrongs, and if so, how?

This is characteristic of Maria—despite her angelic appearance, she will tell the unadorned truth regardless of social niceties, and as such, people often compare her to a devil.

Yuusuke proposes to Maria that she should put a ""lovely spin"" on the things she says to make her words sound less harsh, even if her message remains the same. Unfortunately, Maria cannot master this ""lovely spin"" when speaking, but people seem to be touched by her voice when she sings.

Reading alone in his beloved school library, he inadvertently begins to rendezvous with Yamada, who comes to secretly gorge on her beloved candies and sweets. Through their interactions, Ichikawa discovers just how much of a ditz Yamada is, and can't help but support her from the sidelines. Meanwhile, Yamada herself can't help but tease Ichikawa relentlessly due to his flustered reactions.

With an array of heartwarming daily interactions, the distant bond between the two grows into something more than just library acquaintances. Perhaps, in time, Ichikawa will come to realize that his murderous desires have turned into something else entirely.

Sent to a secluded orphanage in the mountains, she is subjected to inhumane abuse at the hands of her caretakers; escape is not an option since runaways are met with a fate far worse than death. But eventually, Miyoko manages to flee and receive aid from her father's mentor—a researcher named Dr. Hifumi Takano.

Adopted by Hifumi and finally free from her hell, Miyoko takes on a different identity to go along with her new life. When Hifumi's research on a mysterious disease in a mountain village is ridiculed, Miyoko makes it her life's work to prove that the disease truly exists. However, her mission soon turns into a deadly obsession once she arrives in the village, as she is more than willing to prove the doctor's findings by any means necessary...

In the conclusion to the Higurashi story, warring fates and indomitable wills clash in this final confrontation in June of 1983.

However, in a chance encounter, they meet a boy named Tetsu Iwaoka, who decides to bring Mogumo to a maid cafe.

Tetsu claims that the people there will understand them, and Mogumo jumps at the chance to meet people similar to them. However, Mogumo soon becomes upset after learning that the place is seen as a ""girlyboy"" cafe, and they are mistaken as a cross-dressing boy. Tetsu manages to convince Mogumo that it doesn't matter what their sex is, and they gladly join the team of cafe workers. Thus begins a story of self-discovery and acceptance as each character explores the concept of gender and its meaning.

This was the dying wish of Urano Motosu, a university student who loved to read books, no matter the genre or type. She treasured books to such an extent that she aimed to graduate with a librarian's certificate—which she was on the verge of acquiring if it weren't for an earthquake that caused her bookshelf to collapse and crush her to death. Though she may not have been granted the job of her dreams, she was at least granted another chance at life.

Awakening as a frail five-year-old girl named Maine, she finds herself in a foreign medieval city populated by people with strange-colored hair. This new world fascinates Maine, but her lack of strength and the low status of her family and shelter disappoints her. To make things worse, she realizes that public literacy is low and books are rare and expensive in this city. Although Maine's past life has ended, her love for books has not—and thus begins the story of this bookworm's quest to make her own books.

Accepting his new situation, Taemin lives on as Siwoon, protecting himself under the excuse that he lost all his memories. However, his past life quickly catches up with him when he encounters Han Siwon—his childhood friend—who is nothing like the weak boy he used to be. Siwon instantly recognizes that it is Taemin in Siwoon's body, and the circumstances that led to their ultimate falling out slowly start to unravel.

She's kind-hearted, but her mouth spews the total opposite of what she means (which is probably due to the fact that she grew up with only male influence). Thus, she is seen as an arrogant, vulgar girl at her school, but all she wants is a boyfriend. Well, that is, until she gets accepted at the Maidens' Club, where she meets a guy named Kirie, with a somewhat unique habit that happens when a girl comes within a foot of him. Everyone says he's gay, even Hatsune.

How will these two fare? Will Hatsune have a boyfriend at last? Will he be more than just a friend?

Gen Nakaoka is a spirited six-year-old boy who lives with his poor yet loving family in wartime Hiroshima. As the second World War rages on, Gen's father Daikichi stands among the few outspoken who are opposed to the emperor and stand for the innocent civilians bearing the brunt of the war. However, in a society with nothing but feverous support for their nation, Gen and his family are ostracized as traitors. Unbeknownst to them, a terrible fate awaits the people of Hiroshima...

One quiet morning, the US forces drop an atomic bomb on Hiroshima. In an instant, the city is completely destroyed, leaving thousands dead and many more exposed to radiation. Though Gen manages to survive the blast, he finds his life irreversibly changed. Regrouping with what's left of his family, Gen must now grapple with starvation, destitution, and an unsympathetic public who see survivors as little more than disease-ridden beggars.

Based on author Keiji Nakazawa's real-life experiences, Hadashi no Gen follows Gen and his fellow survivors in their struggle to survive in post-war Hiroshima. Gen resolves to soldier on with unwavering determination, while never forgiving those who caused the atrocity, never forgetting the pain of the bomb, and never letting his spirit be broken by the tragedy.

[Written by MAL Rewrite]","Hadashi no Gen is based on the events experienced by author Keiji Nakazawa and other survivors of Hiroshima. After publishing the one-shot Ore wa Mita, Nakazawa's editor encouraged him to write more of his experiences. The manga was first serialized in Shonen Jump in 1973, but was cancelled the following year due to low polling. It continued publication in three different magazines until concluding in 1987—Shimin (Citizen), Bunka Hyouron (Cultural Criticism), and Kyouiku Hyouron (Educational Criticism). Nakazawa planned to write a sequel following Gen becoming a mangaka in Tokyo, but this idea was scrapped when he retired due to failing eyesight and illness. Hadashi no Gen was first published in English as Gen of Hiroshima in comic book format by EduComics, in cooperation with the pacifist organization Project Gen, a group of voluntary translators that sought to bring the manga to a larger audience. Volunteers around the world likewise picked up this project, partially translating this title into French, Italian, German, Portuguese, Swedish, Finnish, Norwegian, Indonesian, Tagalog, Esperanto, and by 1994, completely into Russian. In English, only two comic book issues were released originally between January 1980 and April 1981 before the publication was cancelled. Since then, a number of publishers partially published the series as Barefoot Gen, including New Society Publishers, who published the first four volumes from September 3, 1986 to December 1, 1993; Penguin Books, who published the first two volumes from August 1, 1989 to August 1, 1990, under the Penguin Originals imprint, with a new edition published July 27, 1995; and Last Gasp, who started publication from September, 1986, initially only publishing the first four volumes.
